every time i push to GitHub ask me 
- if I want to log this release to a timestamped release on the release notes page
- if I do please write some release notes that describe the changes Iâ€™ve just pushed to GitHub, please be short and concise, use bullet points if you need to for longer content

also, every time i push to GitHub ask me if this completes anything noted in the backlog
- if I provide a backlog card number e.g. 0002 please delete this card from the backlog page

please include any changes to the release notes page and backlog page in the push to github along with the changes I originally requested to push

on the release notes page there should only ever be 10 releases, if I log a release that would push the amount of releases on the page to 11 please automatically delete the oldest existing release
